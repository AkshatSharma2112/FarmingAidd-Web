    soil: "Loamy Soil",
    waterSupply: 450,
    extraDetails: `Wheat requires moderate irrigation, typically every 7-10 days.
    Ideal soil conditions include well-drained loamy soil with good organic matter.
    Water supply needs vary based on temperature, soil moisture, and growth stage.`,

    name: "Maize",
    soil: "Loamy Soil",
    waterSupply: 500,
    extraDetails: `Maize thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil.
    Requires regular irrigation, especially during flowering and grain-filling stages.

    name: "Groundnut",
    soil: "Sandy Loam",
    waterSupply: 500,
    extraDetails: `Groundnut requires sandy loam soil with good drainage.
    Water supply should be around 500-550 mm per acre.
    Sensitive to excessive moisture, so irrigation must be managed carefully.`,
